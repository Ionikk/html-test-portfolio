<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Oh hello there! I am Ionica. I know... not a common name, right? ðŸ˜Ž</p>

<p>
  I was born in Romania, by the sea side, in a town called Constanta. Sorry to
  disappoint you, I was not born in Dracula's vicinity, Transylvania. During my
  childhood I had various hobbies, such as cutting my mother's gowns and fancy
  clothes and re-styling them, sewing them in some brand new fashionable
  articles for my size (mother wasn't impressed by that as you can imagine);
  pulling apart every bit of toy and non-electric machinery that I could get my
  hands on to understand how they were working the way they were (father was
  relatively impressed as he is also one of those that dismantles every system
  to understand it... up until this day!); and one of my most persistent hobby I
  remember being ear-dropping! Yes, you heard it right... I just loved listening
  to others discussions, whispers, anything pretty much! As long as I was
  hearing something new for me to broaden my knowledge. Later in life, I ended
  up studying 4 years of Mathematics and IT (Pascal with pen and paper!) as a
  Baccalaureate profile, then a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology. Moved to London
  when I was 22 years old and enrolled in a Masters in Occupational Psychology.
  Little did I know at the time, but I have always sought to understanding the
  logic behind everything and even during my studies in Psychology... I had a
  preference for the statistics and qualitative/ quantitative studies!

  Fast forward to today, I finally felt the calling that keeps calling me every
  day. Not just a ring and stops soon after... as I feel the other jobs and
  experiences have been. After all the amazing professional and life experiences
  and studies that I've gone through, I found myself looking for that thing that
  would make me not want to go to sleep out of excitement and that I'd gladly
  wake up to work on. And not long ago, after a time of reflection, relaxation
  and reshuffling my thoughts and plans - jumped on a short course in coding!
  Guess what happened after... I got hooked on the challenge for 10 hours
  straight and felt amazing! So here I am, joining this fabulous crowd of people
  with the same interest and excited to learn and grow with each coding line!
